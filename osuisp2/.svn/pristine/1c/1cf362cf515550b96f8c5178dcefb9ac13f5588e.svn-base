Hi 

I will not give here the answers but just the we to do the 
work.

Theres three category of things you have to consider:

1- the part wich contain the jtag port (processor, fpga..)
2- the flash memory you want to flash (amd, intel, atmel..)
3- the bus wich indicate how the part and the flash are 
connected together on your card.

Use the patches that are on the site as exemples to 
inderstand how to do your job.

Exemples:

1- for the part (processor) with jtag:
  -have a look at the patch 1173994 for the IBM PPC405EP
    - you will need bsdl file of your processor and use
    - bsdl2jtag to transform your file
    - he add a directory jtag-0.5.1/data/ibm
    - add and modify same files... look at the patch
  - understand what that mean and do the same think

2- you have to add your flash :
  - have a look at the patch 1281666 for the Am29LV040B
    - he modify the jtag-0.5.1/libbrux/flash/amd.c file
    - he modify the jtag-0.5.1/libbrux/flash/jedec.c
  - understand what that mean and do the same think

3 - you have to add your bus (interconnexion card) betwin
the processor and the flash
 - look at the second party of the patch 1173994 where  
begin at line 756 with jtag-0.5.1.orig/src/bus
 - you have to modify this directory files buses.h buses.c
 - writing and adding your own bus description ixp425.c 
(look at the examples to understand what to do)


generally:
You have also to understand
- the architecture of the jtag-0.5.1 project 
- how to modify makefiles
- to install the ioperm-0.4 for managing the parallel port
- to install the include-0.4.2 wich contains the *.h files
- to install cygwin (if you work under windows) with 
developpement pack which contain debug module 
- prefer a fast and quick PC for not to wast the time 
during compilation
- perhaps an logic analyser for debugging your hardware

I  took about 1 month (during wasting time) to understand 
all of this things and do it for flashing 
an AT49BV322A atmel flash 
with the spartan 3 xc3s1500 xilinx fpga
on the DS-BD-3S1500MB-FG676 memec card

good work
