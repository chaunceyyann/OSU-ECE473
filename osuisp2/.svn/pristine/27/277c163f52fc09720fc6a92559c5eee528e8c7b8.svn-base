Follow the steps below to generate an SVF file which can be used to program the PROM on the Tekbots FPGA board.

Design your program in Xilinx as normal
Under Configure Target Device in the Processes pane, click Manage Configuration Project (iMPCT)
Select Prepare a PROM File
Click Next
Select Xilinx PROM
Select MCS Format
Choose a name for your file under PROM File Name
Click Next
Choose Serial Mode
Click Next
Choose xcf02s and click Add
Click Next then Finish
An Add Device Dialog will appear. Click OK
When prompted, select the .bit file in your project directory
You should be asked whether you want to add another device file to Data Stream: 0.  Click No then OK.
In the panel on the right side of the screen, click Generate File.
You should see a big blue message saying PROM File Generation Succeeded

In the panel on the left side of the screen, click Boundary Scan
Right click in the middle panel and click Add Xilinx Device
Select the .mcs file you create earlier
Select xcf02s as the Part Name

Go to Output -> SVF FILE -> Create SVF File
Enter a name for your svf file
Right Click on the picture of the Xilinx chip and click program
Select Load FPGA, leave other programming properties as default
You should see another big blue box saying Programming Succeed
Go to Output -> SVF FILE -> Stop Writing to SVF File

Your SVF file will now be in your project directory.
You can now use urjtag to program the PROM chip with this file.
