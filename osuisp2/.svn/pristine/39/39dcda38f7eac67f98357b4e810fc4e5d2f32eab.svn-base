Building Universal GUI:

Step 1: Install QT
- Install the full QT build
- Add necessary environment variables (to the folder where qmake exists)

Step 2: Have some sort of make installed

Step 3: Run build.bat
- This should create makefiles and run make, creating the Universal GUI program in the release folder.
